SVM - Support vector Machine 
A support vector machine (also known as a support vector network) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that analyzes data for classification and regression.

The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers, Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica.
Each class contains 4 features
‘Sepal length’
‘Sepal width’
